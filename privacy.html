    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: August 31, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MemoryWeaver.ai respects your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you visit our site or join our waitlist.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect your email address when you join the waitlist. We may also collect usage data via Google Analytics (e.g., page views, without identifying you personally).</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your email is used to notify you about product updates. Submissions are stored securely on Netlify (our hosting provider), which processes form data on our behalf. We don't sell or share your information with third parties, except for service providers like Netlify for storage and handling.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use encryption and secure practices to protect your data. Netlify stores submissions with industry-standard security, but no system is 100% secure.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can request access, correction, or deletion of your data by emailing [your-email@domain.com]. For EU users, we comply with GDPR.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy; check back for changes.</p>
